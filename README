In this so called project I experiment with various
techniques for converting calculation into a graphical
result and to see how far may the algorithms be generalised,
that is, taking the boundary functions beyond

y = 0
y = 1/x

In the case of the above, the coordinates have been worked
out mathematically -- dependant on the coordinates of
the previous square; no general form may be found thus a
paper-only solution may not be warranted.
